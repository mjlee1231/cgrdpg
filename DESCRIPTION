Title: GRDPG with Contextual Covariates via Fisher Scoring
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Myung-Jin", family = "Lee", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "your.email@example.com"))
Description: Implements a practical estimator for the generalized random dot product graph (GRDPG)
    with Gaussian contextual covariates B = Z X^T + W, using an adjacency spectral embedding (ASE)
    initialization followed by Fisher scoring updates with smoothed log-likelihood (psi smoothing).
